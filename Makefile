tyler cant you tell im being vulnerable the whole time.
I was insecure and so terribly afraid that you would leave me for another person 
and all I asked for was a relationship without another person.
You did the thing I was most afraid of not once but so many times. 
Do you understand it kills me. IT LITERALLY KILLS ME to experience this so many times. 
Are you seriously not able to comprehensive not even a tiny little bit the pain you keep imposing on me? 
ALL I ASK is the most basic thing where there is no third person involved. You hurt me so badly. 
Why do you keep doing this? Why are you avoiding this.
Can you really live your life without finding out how amazing
it would be if an exclusive relationship between us could happen? 

Please stop torturning me anymore. PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE. I'm really about to die.
I can't live like this anymore
